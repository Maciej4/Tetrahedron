# Swarm Navigation Control Systems for Linking Tetrahedral Linear Acutator Robots

## Definitions
A tetrahedral linear actautor robot, or tetrobot has several characteristics:
- [Tetrahedral shape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron)
- Edges of tetrobots are linear actuators
- Able to connect to other tetrobots
This system allows for shape morphing robots which can work together to achieve tasks

## Summary
Tetrobot swarm simulator, made for Synospsys Science Fair 2019 made in Unity 3D, with code being written in C#

## Current Features
The current features as of 15 March 2019 are:
- Single Tetrahedron Walk
- Connection of tetrobots
- Adjustment of side lengths for all robots in a "glob"
